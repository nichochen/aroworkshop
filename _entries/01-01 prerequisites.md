If you haven't provisioned an environment yet, please go ahead and create one now. You should have been given access to a Microsoft Hands-on Labs environment for this workshop through a registration link and an activation code. If you don't have one, please ask your proctors. For more information, please go to the [Microsoft Hands-on Labs](https://www.microsoft.com/handsonlabs/) website.

Please continue the registration with the activation code you've been provided.

The Azure subscription and associated lab credentials will be provisioned. This will take a few moments. This process will also provision an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster.

Once the environment is provisioned, a screen with all the appropriate lab credentials will be presented. Additionally, you'll have your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster endpoint. The credentials will also be emailed to the email address entered at registration.
